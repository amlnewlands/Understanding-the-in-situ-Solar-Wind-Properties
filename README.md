# Understanding the in-situ Solar Wind Properties with Machine Learning

The project objective is to expand understanding of solar wind properties by incoporating machine learning tools to in-situ observations. The complexity and density of solar wind data makes pattern recognition difficult and puts potential applications of such data in question. Our goal is to find patterns within the in-situ observations that can forecast Heliospheric Current Sheet (HCS) indexes.   


## Environment

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. Instructions for Poetry are below. A  <a href="https://github.com/amlnewlands/Understanding-the-in-situ-Solar-Wind-Properties/blob/main/requirements.txt">requirements</a> file is also available if preferred. 

#### Poetry Setup

Assuming you have pip installed, run the following in your terminal:

```
pip install poetry
```
After downloading the repository you should see a lock and toml file:

![alt text](https://github.com/amlnewlands/Understanding-the-in-situ-Solar-Wind-Properties/blob/main/images/poetryfiles.PNG?raw=true)



<b>PLEASE NOTE: This poetry environment will require Python ver. 3.11 or above. </b>

While in the project directory you can run the following command to activate the dependency installed poetry environment as your kernel. This will set poetry to install the environment in a new .venv folder inside of the python project (directory). :
```
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```
The lock file is what dictates to poetry the dependency versions all users should adhere to. Toml lists the dependencies and versions for each. With these files confirmed in your repository download and run the following in your terminal:

```
poetry install
```

Poetry install will create a virtual environment for the workspace and install all dependencies according to the toml file. 



In order to add modules the team utilized the following command:

```
poetry add <module/library>
```

## Code structure

Project code is organized in 6 jupyter notebooks. Please refer to the <a href = "https://github.com/amlnewlands/Understanding-the-in-situ-Solar-Wind-Properties/tree/main/src">src folder</a> for these notebooks. They are ordered with a double digit designation and are meant to be run sequentially from 01 to 06.


## Data
All datasets referred by the notebooks can be found in the <a href = "https://github.com/amlnewlands/Understanding-the-in-situ-Solar-Wind-Properties/tree/main/data"> data folder</a>. All datasets including those generated by notebooks are stored in this folder for convenience. Please see below for dataset feature descriptions. 

### ACE Mission Level 2 SWEPAM Dataset

The Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) Mission is a satellite deployed by NASA to collect and analyze particles from solar, interplanetary, and interstellar origins. While the ACE Mission collects various types of particle information, our project focus was on Solar Wind Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor (SWEPAM) measurements provided by ACE. The level 2 dataset from the SWEPAM is organized into 27-day time periods that contain time averages of solar wind parameters. Data features for ion measurements include density, velocity coordinates, temperature, and speed. Missing data for a given time period is logged as -9999.9. Overall this dataset amounts to 204,768 rows. Data can be downloaded in space-delimited file format from <a href="https://izw1.caltech.edu/ACE/ASC/level2/lvl2DATA_SWEPAM.html"> ACE data site </a> and selecting Hourly Averages full data range.

### Sunspot Number 
The sunspot number dataset is a collection of sunspot counts dating back to 1749. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Solar Influences Data Analysis Center in Belgium maintain the official sunspot number dataset. Sunspot numbers are calculated based on the initial count of sunspot groups along with the number of individual sunspots that can be observed. The sunspot number is the sum of individual sunspots plus the number of sunspots multiplied by 10. Sunspot groups are multiplied by 10 due to the groups on average having 10 spots within. Our project used the monthly mean Sunspot Number dataset. Data can be downloaded in TXT file format from <a href="https://www.sidc.be/SILSO/datafiles">SIDC data site</a> and selecting Monthly Mean Total Sunspot Number.

### HCS Indexes
<br><font color="#f31e13"><b>NOTE: This dataset is not public and can only be viewed/distributed with approval from the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor Department of Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering. For grading purposes this dataset is currently included but will be omitted after review</b></font>

The HCS indexes dataset was developed by Dr. Zhao at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor Department of Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering. The dataset focuses on two parameters, SD and SL. SD is the latitudinal deviation of the HCS from the Sun’s equator. SL is the waviness of the HCS in reference to the Sun’s equator. These indexes are used to track the HCS structure over time. These two variables are the outcome variables for the HCS forecast model. The dataset contains features for fractional year, the two indexes SD_70 and SL 70, and ten other features derived from SD_70 and SL_70 which were not of interest for this study. The dataset consists of 596 entries recorded from 1976 to 2022, with each observation corresponding to a single rotation of the sun which takes 27.2753 days, called a Carrington rotation.
